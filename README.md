# Tabletop Game Recommendation Engine

## Overview
This is a personal project, where I developed a board game recommendation engine using content-based filtering. This project was created to enhance my skills in ETL, EDA, and text processing, as well as providing a recommendation engine for exploration of new table top games to play.

This is for anyone interested in exploring potential boardgames, card games, or any other physical game played on a tabletop to play, based on an existing game you already like. 

This uses data from Board Game Geek, which was extracted using their public ranked board game dataset and API. I applied initial filters to restrict game recommendations to base games that have an average rating of 7/10 or higher and received at least 100 votes to ensure the recommendations are relevant and trustworthy.
